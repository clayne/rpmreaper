.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrpmreaper\fR [\fB-lvh\fR] [\fB-r\fR \fIroot\fR] [\fIlimit\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
rpmreaper is a simple ncurses application with a mutt-like interface that
allows removing unnecessary packages and their dependencies from the system.

.SH PACKAGE FLAGS
.TP 8
\fBL\fR

.TP 8
\fBD\fR
Marked to be removed.
.TP 8
\fBo\fR
Part of a dependency cycle.
.TP 8
\fBB\fR
Missing dependencies.
.TP 8
\fBb\fR
Some packages required by the package are marked to be removed.

.SH SEARCH EXPRESSIONS

Search expression is a regular expression which can be optionally extended with
roughly mutt-esque directives for matching package flags. Overall search
expression syntax looks like this:

{[!]~\fIflags\fR }[\fIregexp\fR]

Recognized flags are described in the section \fBPACKAGE FLAGS\fR. Search
expression matches a package, if the following three conditions hold: any of
the flags specified in \fB~\fR directives is set; none of the flags specified
in \fB!~\fR directives are set; and the specified regular expression matches
the \fBn-v-r[.a]\fR string of the package.

Examples:

.TP 8
\fB~Ll i386$\fR
Match all leaf and partial leaf i386 packages.
.TP 8
\fB!~D perl\fR
Match all perl packages except those marked for deletion.
